This set of Rust projects followed along, up to a certain point, 
a video playlist by Tech With Tim:

I removed all cargo managing, and am now playing with simple files 
- for accessability and simplicity's sake.
This is, I'm still working on a very simplistic and basic level, 
and cargo doesn't seem to add much to the experience right now.

Compile simple files with:

rustc <filename>

Compiled programs go into 'Compiled' and scripts go into 'Scripts',
obviously. Scripts are writen in this folder and, when 'finished', 
they get compiled and the files are put in their appropriate spots.



Enjoy
